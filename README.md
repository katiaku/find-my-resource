## About Project

Find My Resource is a fully responsive web app to help users navigate the many helpful resources that have been added to the Chingu platform.

It makes learning easier by giving users the ability to search for resource based on title, author or by topics that interest them.

---

## Features

- Search resources by author or full title or word / part of word
- Filter resources by tag(s)
- Resource cards show title, author, created date, rating and tags
- Print out the list of resources
- Create user profile and access user dashboard
- Create collection of resources (only for registered users)
- Rate resources (only for registered users)

---

## How it works

Easily find resources that would be of interest to you by searching through the Chingu resources by typing the full title / part of the title of the resource or author if you know exactly what you are looking for, or you can choose to search for resource for topics that interest you by using the available tags.

The data is paginated so that the resources are displayed in manageable chunks.
